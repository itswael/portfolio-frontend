        I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a passion for building reliable, scalable systems that solve real-world problems. From architecting microservices in Spring Boot and Flask to automating workflows with Redis and Golang, my work reflects a balance of deep technical rigor and clear business impact.
        I take ownership seriously — not just of the code I write, but of the outcomes it drives. Whether working solo or as part of a cross-functional team, I believe in high standards, strong collaboration, and delivering solutions that last. My experience spans everything from secure API design and cloud deployment to AI-integrated features and performance optimization.
        Curiosity fuels everything I do. I'm continuously exploring new tools, frameworks, and architectural patterns — currently diving into React and machine learning to expand my full-stack and AI capabilities.
        I approach software with a builder’s mindset: invent, simplify, dive deep, and deliver. I value systems that are not only functional, but elegant. I care about clean code, thoughtful abstractions, and above all, how technology can serve people better.
        If you're looking for someone who blends backend expertise with a sharp eye for detail, a hunger to learn, and a bias for action — let's connect.
